{"name":"Extending Bach Chorales with HMMs","tagline":"Extending Bach Chorales using Hidden Markov Models","body":"### Extending Bach-Chorales with HMMs\r\nThis project was started with the intention of getting our hands dirty with the classical algorithms instrumental in training Hidden Markov Models such as Forward-Backward algorithm, Viterbi algorithm and Baum-Welch algorithm. The next step would be to try out more recent techniques used in HMMs and probabilistic graphical models. Ones that come to my mind are the ones described in http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/papers/v9/siddiqi10a/siddiqi10a.pdf and in chapter 3 and 4 of http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~bboots3/files/BootsThesis.pdf.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
